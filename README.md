Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :)

Hi all, my name's Cameron. I'm a 5th year masters student with an interest in bioinformatics. I hail from northern NH and am an avid outdoorsman. Additionally, I played football and rugby in undergrad, love to play guitar and the keyboard, and I eat a lot of ice cream :)
